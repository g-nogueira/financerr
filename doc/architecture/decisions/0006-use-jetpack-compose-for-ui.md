# 6. Use Jetpack Compose for UI

## Context

We need to choose a UI framework for the app's frontend development. The options considered were Jetpack Compose and ViewBinding/DataBinding. The decision is driven by the need for modernity, functional programming familiarity, type safety, and ease of future scalability.

## Decision

We will use **Jetpack Compose** for the following reasons:
1. **Modern and Declarative UI Framework**: Jetpack Compose is the latest UI toolkit from Google, designed to create Android UIs in a more intuitive and flexible way.
2. **Functional Programming Paradigm**: As the developer has a background in functional programming (F#), Jetpack Compose's declarative approach aligns well with this experience. It offers a reactive, declarative way to manage UI state, similar to frameworks like React and Svelte, which the developer is also familiar with.
3. **Type Safety**: Jetpack Compose offers great type safety since all UI logic and elements are created directly in Kotlin. This reduces the risk of mismatched view IDs or types, which can occur with XML-based approaches like ViewBinding/DataBinding.
4. **Interoperability with Kotlin**: The entire UI is written in Kotlin, meaning we benefit from the Kotlin compiler's type safety, null-safety, and code consistency.
5. **No XML Layouts**: Jetpack Compose removes the need for XML layouts, which simplifies the development process and makes it easier to maintain and scale the UI logic.
6. **Community and Ecosystem**: Jetpack Compose has a growing community and strong official support from Google, making it a future-proof solution for Android app development.
7. **Integration with Material You**: Compose has built-in support for Material You, making it easier to create personalized, dynamic UIs aligned with Androidâ€™s latest design principles.

## Consequences

### **Pros**:
1. **Declarative UI**: Jetpack Compose allows for a more functional, declarative style of programming, which is a good fit for the developer's background in F# and modern technologies like React and Svelte.
2. **Type Safety and Compile-Time Checks**: Being fully integrated with Kotlin, Compose benefits from Kotlin's compile-time safety, reducing the chance of runtime errors.
3. **Modern and Future-Proof**: As a modern toolkit with strong backing from Google, Compose ensures that the app will be developed with the latest UI technologies.
4. **Reduced Boilerplate**: Without XML layouts, Compose reduces the need for boilerplate code, leading to more maintainable code and faster development iterations.
5. **Dynamic UIs with Material You**: Seamless integration with Material You helps deliver personalized, user-friendly interfaces that adapt to the user's preferences.

### **Cons**:
1. **Learning Curve**: Jetpack Compose, while modern, may require some additional time to fully grasp, especially for features like complex animations or transitions. The developer's learning interest mitigates this somewhat.
2. **Limited Cross-Platform Potential**: Compose is not cross-platform (iOS or web) by default, so expanding to other platforms might require additional effort.
3. **Maturity and Edge Cases**: While growing rapidly, Jetpack Compose is still newer than XML-based approaches. Some features may require custom implementations, especially for very specific use cases or UI elements.
