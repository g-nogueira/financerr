# 8. Use ViewModel and StateFlow for State Management

Date: 2024-09-07

## Status

Accepted

## Context

We need to decide on a state management solution for the Android app that aligns with the MVVM architecture and Jetpack Compose. The goal is to ensure efficient state management that integrates well with our chosen UI framework and supports modern development practices.

## Decision

We will use **ViewModel** in combination with **StateFlow** for state management in the app.

This decision is based on the following criteria:
- **Reactive Updates**: **StateFlow** provides a reactive approach to state management, ensuring that the UI automatically updates when state changes.
- **Immutability**: **StateFlow** encourages immutability, reducing side effects and making the codebase more predictable and manageable.
- **Integration with Jetpack Compose**: **StateFlow** works seamlessly with Jetpack Compose, supporting its declarative UI model and reducing the need for manual state management.
- **Type Safety**: Using **StateFlow** with **ViewModel** ensures type safety, which aligns with our preference for compile-time checks and reliability.
- **Official Support**: Both **ViewModel** and **StateFlow** are officially supported by Google, ensuring that we are using well-maintained and widely adopted technologies.

## Consequences

### Pros:
- **Automatic UI Updates**: The UI automatically reflects state changes without requiring manual intervention, reducing the risk of errors.
- **Immutability**: Encourages immutability, leading to more predictable and easier-to-maintain code.
- **Reactive Design**: Supports a reactive and event-driven approach, enhancing scalability and maintainability.
- **Seamless Integration**: Works well with Jetpack Compose, leveraging its modern features and ensuring a smooth development experience.
- **Official Support**: Backed by Google, providing reliability and ongoing updates.

### Cons:
- **Learning Curve**: Developers unfamiliar with reactive programming and **StateFlow** may face a learning curve.
- **Overhead**: Managing state with **StateFlow** introduces some overhead compared to simpler state management solutions.
- **Complexity**: The added complexity of **StateFlow** might be unnecessary for very simple state management needs, but this is offset by the benefits of using a modern and scalable approach.
