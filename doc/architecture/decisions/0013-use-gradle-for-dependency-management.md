Date: 2024-09-08

## Status

Accepted

## Context

We need to choose a dependency management tool for handling libraries and project configurations in our Android app. The solution should integrate well with Android Studio, handle dependencies efficiently, and be widely supported within the Android ecosystem.

## Decision

We will use **Gradle** as the dependency management tool for this project.

This decision is based on the following criteria:
- **Integration with Android Studio**: Gradle is the official build tool for Android and integrates seamlessly with Android Studio.
- **Flexibility**: Provides extensive customization options for build configurations and dependency management.
- **Community and Support**: Widely used in the Android development community with extensive documentation and support.
- **Performance**: Continually improving with features like incremental builds and build cache to optimize performance.
- **Plugin Ecosystem**: A rich ecosystem of plugins for various tasks including code quality checks, packaging, and more.

## Consequences

- Pros:
  - **Official Tool**: Gradle is the officially supported build and dependency management tool for Android, ensuring compatibility and support.
  - **Integration**: Seamless integration with Android Studio, providing a streamlined development experience.
  - **Flexibility**: Highly customizable build configurations, which can be tailored to meet specific project needs.
  - **Community Support**: Strong community support and extensive documentation available for troubleshooting and guidance.
  - **Performance**: Features like incremental builds and build cache help in managing build times and efficiency.

- Cons:
  - **Complexity**: Gradle can become complex for larger projects with many dependencies, requiring careful management of configurations.
  - **Learning Curve**: Initial setup and configuration may have a learning curve, especially for developers new to Gradle.
